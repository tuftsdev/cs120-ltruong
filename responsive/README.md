# About Homer Responsive
  Homer image responsive base by the screen size by using CSS styling. There will be eight frames out of a single image, and the image size is 333x500. Therefore, each frame size would be 166.5px x 125px. With that, I can set the div to be each frame size, and the background would be the top-left position of each frame base on the screen size.
