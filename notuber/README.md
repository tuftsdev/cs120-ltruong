# About LAB 8 - The Ride-Hailing Service - Part 2
  The project uses google API and Rides API to get the closest rideâ€”the calculation between the user and rides using the Haversine formula. To get the ride, the user must allow the app to get the location and click on its marker to reveal the shortest ride.
