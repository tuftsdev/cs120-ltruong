# About LAB 6: DOM
  This project added annotations for the Union Strike Folk Song by manipulating the DOM object. The project is very straightforward: first, add the time update listener to the video element. Then get the video's current time and compare it against the lyric object to see if any of the lyrics is within the time range. Finally, populate the inner HTML to the lyric div.
